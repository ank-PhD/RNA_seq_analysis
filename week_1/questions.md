- how to extract strand directions from the pileup format?

- I chopped 70 bp on each side before calculating the coverage in order to account for the 
  decreased probability of sequencing the ends of reads

- instead of the rpkm I used a "normalized coverage depth" followed by the quintile normalization
  to make sure timepoints were comparable between them
